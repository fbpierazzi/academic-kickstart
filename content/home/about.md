# Biography

I'm a Post-Doctoral Researcher of the Systems Security Lab (S2Lab), between King's College London and Royal Holloway, University of London. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Modena, Italy, in March 2017.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and cybersecurity, with particular focus on program analysis, malware analysis and (occasionally) traffic anomaly detection. If you are interested in my research, contact me!
