# Biography

I'm a Post-Doctoral Researcher of the **Systems Security Lab (S2Lab)**, between **King's College London** and **Royal Holloway, University of London**. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in March 2017. I spent most of last year of my Ph.D. as a visiting research scholar at University of Maryland, College Park.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and cybersecurity, with particular focus on  malware analysis, program analysis** and (occasionally) traffic anomaly detection. If you are interested in my research, contact me!
